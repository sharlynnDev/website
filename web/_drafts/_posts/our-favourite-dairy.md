In our search for fresh produce we are in a fabulous position on the Tablelands also know as <!--more-->

 Dairyland. And I know why I love photographing the landscape apart from always looking spectacular, all the dutch cows remind me of the Netherlands. This image was made just near Mungalli Creek Dairy, where we source all our milk, yoghurt and quark cheese. Visit the cafe at 254 Brooks Road, Millaa Millaa to try all the Biodynamic Dairy products and lots of other delicious foods.
