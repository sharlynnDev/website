Around the Sharlynn area along the river there is a family of tree kangaroos that move around <!--more--> and can be seen from time to time. They were named for the explorer who first found them, Carl Lumholtz, in 1882. These two photographed from the verandah at the cabin are a juvenile and Mum. They stay together for around 3 years. Really exciting to see them in the wild.
