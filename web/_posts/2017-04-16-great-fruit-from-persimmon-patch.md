We always try to find the best local produce that is in season, and just 10 minutes down the roadÂ <!--more-->have found Howard and Tamara growing persimmons under a 4 acre bird deterrent net. They are an amazing fruit and we like them crispy and cool, like eating a fresh apple. Can also make a great addition to salads and stir fries, or muffins. Best of all they have many unique health properties. If you would like to visit the farm they are at 357 Marks Lane, Ph 0438 981 014.<!--more-->
